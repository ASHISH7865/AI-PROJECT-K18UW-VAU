Day by day networks are becoming more complex. The growing need of internet made us to depend on computer network, so the network security plays a major role. Thatâ€™s why, we need to find a best possible way to protect our systems. The security of the system is compromised when the intrusion takes place.Intrusion is a kind of malicious assault that may enter to the gadget or network silently. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a software that keeps an eye on  network or system for spiteful activities warns to take appropriate action in contradiction of intrusion. An IDS must be highly accurate to detect the nasty activities on thefor  An IDS monitoring system must be highly efficient to protect system and network. The against the intrusion detection systems (IDS) are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, and reporting attempts. A best intrusion system can be designed by using data mining and statistical techniques.  We can use data mining and statistical techniques to make a better intrusion detection system. IDS check the various parameters and classifies that is it an attack or a normal situationor attack .
